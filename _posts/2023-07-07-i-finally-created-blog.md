After forever planning to make a public blog or journal or notes or whatever you call it, i am finally trying jekyll for blogging!

### Why do i want to create this blog?
I love to write. When i was an elementary school student, i liked to modify lyrics of songs and sang to it, it was probably not good or beautiful, but you can count it as writing, i guess. Well, that is not important actually.

So, when i was in junior high school, or maybe highschool, i don't know, i lost track of time, we used this chatting app called LINE, developed by Naver, a korean company. It's actually an amazing app, i loved it, i don't know why no one in my current environment use it, but yeah it was fun using it. In LINE there is a thing called 'Official Account', which is intended to be used as an account for business, but a lot of people just use it to make account for their community or for sharing news and information, etc. I and some of my online friends actually created one that shares things related to games (inspired by an official account that had a group chat which bring us to meet each other).

So i added a lot of official accounts that share things about gaming, basketball, and anything that i was interested in.  Then, there is one official account called phospemenous (maybe), i forget how to spell it, and that account published poems that is submitted by random people through chat. I read and found a lot of beautiful poems from that account, and since then, i considered that i love poem.

Words are amazing and strong, it can affect you deeply (if you let it to), it can hurt you, it can heal you, it can make you sad as well as making you happy. It can change how people's opinion about you, hell, it can affect the whole world. It's mesmerizing and terrifying at the same time. So, let's be careful of words that came out from ourselves in real life or digitally, alright.

Anyway, i liked to read poem from that account and inspired to make one. At first, affected by my stupid "depressed" condition of myself at the moment, i only wrote shit poems to vent what i felt, that turned out to be good and deep (according to me), either way, i enjoyed it. But then i had friend to share interest in poems with, so i wrote actual poems, showed it to them, and they thought the poem is good and they loved it, and as a normal human being, i was proud of that and love poem even more.

The thing is, not only poem, writing anything is interesting for me, although sometimes i write absurd, cringe, corny, unfunny, or 'im 17 and this is deep' stuff, i found that i like to spend my time in that process. I realized that when i was writing for one of my college assignment and that was the first time i consistently write articles for blogs. I wrote stuffs about technology and wrapped it with corny dry comedy. It's not something i am proud of, but still, i am glad that i am able to share information and knowledge that way.

After i got passed the semester as well as the subject that has the blogging stuff as an assignment, sadly, i don't continue my blog because i had no idea what to write.

Now these days, i explored and will explore many things, found and will acknowledge a lot of new things, which i think i can write and share through things like blog, for myself and for anyone out there that found out about this blog.

I hope that the existence of this blog can be useful or at least insightful for the reader. I also hope that i can consistently write in this blog so that my writing, language, or dev skills can be improved. Yeah, dev skills since i probably will write (mostly and hopefully) about dev.

### Why do i name it 'pinotes'?
So my nickname is pien, and this blog will be kinda similar with notes. pien + notes = pinotes.

### Why do i use jekyll?
Short answer, [banditijo](https://bandithijo.dev/) inspired me. Fun fact, i am motivated to create this because i read a lot of his blogs.

Long answer, will be updated.
